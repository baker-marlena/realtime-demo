Realtime Database Demo Setup

* [Create an project on Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* Update the app.js file with the API key and DatabaseURL
  * Your API Key can be found under Project Settings
  * Your Database URL is under the Database section of your Project
  * This demo doesn't support authentication. Be sure to set the rules of your database to read: true and write: true, in that same section so the site can access your database.
  * You're ready to go. This demo can be run locally.
